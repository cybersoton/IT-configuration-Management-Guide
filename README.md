# The basics
There are few steps that we have to take after you agree on a project (brief/description) and before starting the project 

1. Create a new repository using the agreed project name and description (Please note: Do not start the name with 3rd year project). 
2. Use the [MD guideline found here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to formate your project page.
3. All project document must be written in [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/).
4. For projects that require a test enviroment, please use [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to build your virtual machines. Feel free to use <script src="https://gist.github.com/Nawfal3D/050d73812ea06e1d984a1621c75e790d.js"></script>
5. For projects that requires the development of REST API please use open api specification in [Swagger](https://swagger.io/).
