This guide is meant to help project students and project supervisors to have sustainable academic contribution

# The basics
There are few steps that we have to take after you agree on a project (brief/description) and before starting the project 

1. Create a new repository using the agreed project name and description (Please note: Do not start the name with 3rd year project). 
2. Use the [MD guideline found here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to formate your project page. To get help with managing your git repo use [tutorial here](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).
3. All project document must be written in [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/).
4. For projects that require a test enviroment, please use [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to build your virtual machines. Feel free to use this [cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/Nawfal3D/050d73812ea06e1d984a1621c75e790d).
5. For projects that requires the development of REST API please use open api specification in [Swagger](https://swagger.io/).
6. Supervisors and student must agree on a regural supervision time
7. At each session the supervisor has to do two things
  A - Check his written notes for previous meeting objectives that the student has set for him/her self 
  B - Help the student write new objectives for next week 
8. Triple check the project on git and make sure the tools work
9. Ask for any tutorials that the student used to learn and document it for future student.
